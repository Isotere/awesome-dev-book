1. **A**tomicity: Either all operations complete successfully, or the transaction fails and the DB remains unchanged.
    
2. **C**onsistency: The DB state must be valid after the transaction. All constraints must be satisfied.
    
3. **I**solation: Concurrent transactions must not affect each other.
    
4. **D**urability: Data written by a successful transaction must be recorded in persistent storage.
